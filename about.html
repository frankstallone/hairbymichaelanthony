			<h2>ABOUT</h2>

			<blockquote class="right top"><p>&ldquo;Quality is never an accident; it is always the result of high intention, sincere effort, intelligent direction, and skillful execution; it represents the wise choice of many alternatives.&rdquo;</p> <cite>&mdash; William A. Forester</cite> </blockquote>
			
			<p>As a native of New York City, Michael Anthony is one of the top &ldquo;next generation&rdquo; artists in the Jingles/Pro Rituals International Art Team. He has been committed to working with cutting edge hair trends from around the globe for more than 15 years, performing educational seminars internationally and opening two Michael Anthony Salons along the way.</p>

			<p>Michael is a top caliber hair designer, colorist and educator who has worked on feature films, magazines, and photo shoots as well as charity and promotional events in the fashion industry. His celebrity clientele includes Tommy Lee, Dan Turgerman, Mili Avital, Steve Buscemi, Samuel Jackson, Carol Kane, Spike Lee, Mimi Rogers, and Christian Slater.</p>
			
			<blockquote class="left"><p>&ldquo;It’s not what color you use on the hair, it’s the technique. The technique will work with the haircut, so that haircut and color will reflect the client’s personality.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
			
			<p>Michael&rsquo;s mentor was Don Francis, the Jingles Artistic Director in New York City and the UK for decades, and Michael&rsquo;s early education in the field strongly shaped the course of his career. Don Francis invited Michael to join the team at Jingles academy after just three weeks into a course, seeing his talent and deciding to nurture it. Michael went on to lead training seminars throughout the world–including Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Prague, Austria, and Honduras–as well as a regular class at the Jingles Academy in New York City. He was the key creative force behind the opening of a major hair color brand in 2002. In 2004, the large Italian color manufacturer appointed Michael to head their education department in the United States.</p>

			<p>He is devoted to educating other hair designers on how to create innovative work. His passion shines through whether he is working with a client or teaching a class. He encourages students to use technique as a starting point and to be their own inspiration, giving others the ability to thrive and prosper. Ultimately, Michael&rsquo;s love of hair is reflected in all he does.</p>
			
			<p>Michael Anthony is the Education Director of the Evolution salons in New Jersey, Art Director of Salon ASH in Los Angeles, and International Educator for Jingles/Pro Rituals in San Diego. Michael travels back east every month to service guests.</p>
